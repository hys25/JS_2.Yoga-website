> JavaScript training

In this project, for the first time I made a simple interactive on the site using **JavaScript**. 

At the beginning of the training I didn't know how to divide the code into separate functions - modules, so the whole interactive is in one script.js file. I worked with the ready layout and learned how to make the next interactive: 
- tab switching
- timer
- modal window (button "Узнать больше")
- slider
- calculator

This project is initial, you'll see much more interactive and my knowledge growing in the following projects :)
